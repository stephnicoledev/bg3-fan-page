            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <blockquote>"Since I was born in the cold reaches of Wildspace, I have known but one purpose: to wield a silver sword and ride a red dragon in service of my regent, the githyanki queen Vlaakith. My first step on this path is to slay a mind flayer and bring its head to my queen. There is no flesh I will not carve and no barrier I will not shatter to see it done. I am the one who sunders, I am the Undying Queen's most unshakeable warrior. I am Lae'zel of K'liir." - Lae'zel</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"You find yourself in the presence of the renowned wizarding prodigy, Gale of Waterdeep - please, no need to be intimidated. My virtuosic talents once caught the eye of the goddess of magic herself, Mystra, who named me her Chosen, and her lover. Thanks to a slight miscalculation on my part, that relationship eventually soured, as did the greatest of my powers. Now I'm merely a humble wizard on the road to redemption. Unless I can find the path to something greater..." - Gale</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"
                My name is Shadowheart, loyal servant of Shar, goddess of darkness and loss. There is little more I can tell you than that. My Lady Shar tasked me with a mission of such secrecy that I surrendered great swathes of my memory in order to safeguard the knowledge of it. All I know is that I must bring the artifact I hold to Baldur's Gate, and that nothing can stand in my way." - Shadowheart</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Seven years ago, I was exiled from Baldur's Gate, the city I call home. My name is Wyll, but the people of the Sword Coast call me the Blade of Frontiers - champion of the meek, defender of the innocent. The truth isn't quite so simple, but they're right about one thing. I hunt monsters, and I always catch my prey. My latest target is a devil, and I'm right on her tail. Once I'm through with her, she'll never escape the fires of the first Hell." - Wyll</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Ten years ago, I was sold to the archdevil Zariel - she put a hellfire engine in my chest and made me her prize soldier. But I've escaped now - thank you, mind flayers - and I've got a few scores to settle, if this engine doesn't burn me to ash first. I'll need people I can trust. An infernal mechanic. And a serious amount of luck. But you know what? I'm not worried. After ten years in the Hells, I can take on anything. I've got my chance at freedom, and believe me - I'm going home." - Karlach</blockquote>
